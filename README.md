# Development Impact GPT
How AI and ChatGPT can help impact investing? Throughout my tenure as an analyst in impact investing, I've consistently encountered the intricate challenge of effectively drafting narratives and disseminating knowledge about development impact. This process, while essential, often feels like navigating through a dense forest without a map for the broader impact investing community.

To alleviate these challenges, I and my colleague Gaurav Jain have crafted the Development Impact GPT tool. While it employs IFC's public development impact disclosure data as a foundational example, its essence is tailored for the expansive international finance community:

- Efficiency Gains for Investment Officers & Impact Economists: This tool streamlines the narrative crafting process by learning from similar projects, ensuring the narrative of development impact is both time-efficient and rich in depth.

- Knowledge Sharing: Distilling insights from similar deals provides a clearer picture for a broader audience, helping them understand the potential ramifications and benefits of various projects.

I warmly invite you to delve into this tool, culminating our shared experiences and challenges in impact investing. Your insights and feedback will be pivotal as we continue to hone its offerings.
